## üéØ For Your 100-200 Record Test

**Recommended approach:**
1. Start with your most important contacts (executives, key decision makers)
2. Include 5-10 different companies to test company grouping
3. Make sure you have a mix of:
   - Different company types (advertisers, agencies, vendors)
   - Complete vs. minimal data (to test both scenarios)
   - Contacts with and without emails

**Test dataset checklist:**
- [ ] 100-200 total rows
- [ ] 5-10 unique companies
- [ ] All 4 required fields filled for every row
- [ ] At least 50% have email addresses
- [ ] At least 50% have company websites
- [ ] Mix of seniority levels (executives, directors, managers)

## üöÄ What Happens During Import

The system will automatically:
1. **Group contacts by company** - Multiple contacts at same company are linked
2. **Generate logos** - Fetches company logos from Clearbit using domain/website
3. **Generate photos** - Creates contact photos using Gravatar (if email) or initials
4. **Detect duplicates** - Prevents importing same company/contact twice
5. **Smart merging** - Updates existing records if better data is provided
6. **Create relationships** - Links contacts to their companies

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have email addresses?**
A: That's okay! Emails are optional. We'll generate placeholder photos using initials.

**Q: Can I have multiple contacts from the same company?**
A: Yes! The system groups them automatically. Use the exact same `companyName` for all contacts at that company.

**Q: What if company website is missing?**
A: We'll try to extract the domain from contact emails. But providing it gives better logo results.

**Q: Can I import the same data multiple times?**
A: Yes! The system has duplicate detection. If you import the same company/contact again, it will either skip or update the existing record (not create duplicates).
