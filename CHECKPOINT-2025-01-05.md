# 🎯 PROJECT CHECKPOINT - January 5, 2025

## Overview
This checkpoint captures the current state of the DealMecca platform after significant forum system optimizations and UI improvements. The project has been successfully stabilized with all critical issues resolved.

## ✅ Recent Achievements

### Forum System Fixes
- **Fixed aiTags Field Error**: Resolved 500 responses in forum posts API by excluding problematic AI fields (`aiTags`, `aiProcessed`, `aiSummary`, `aiVersion`) from database queries
- **Streamlined Post Creation**: Removed title field from create post form and implemented auto-title generation from content (first 50 characters)
- **Company Attribution**: Successfully displaying company information (Publicis Media, Disney+, GroupM, etc.) in forum posts
- **Mention System**: Fully operational @company, @contact, and @topic mentions with autocomplete

### Technical Improvements
- **Database Performance**: Implemented manual data enrichment with lookup maps for better performance
- **API Stability**: Forum posts API returning consistent 200 responses with proper data structure
- **Code Organization**: Fixed Prisma model naming conventions (singular model names)
- **Server Stability**: Development server running smoothly at localhost:3000

### Project Structure Reorganization
- **Documentation**: Moved all docs to `/docs` folder for better organization
- **Testing**: Consolidated test files in `/tests` folder
- **Deployment**: Organized deployment files in `/deployment` folder
- **Data**: Created `/data` folder for sample data files
- **Clean Root**: Removed clutter from project root directory

2. **Auto-generation**: Auto-generating titles from content can improve UX by reducing form complexity
3. **Project Organization**: Moving documentation and tests to dedicated folders significantly improves project clarity
4. **Performance**: Manual data enrichment can be more performant than deep Prisma includes
