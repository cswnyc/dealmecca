## Company Matching & Auto-Creation

### How Companies Are Matched

The system matches companies by **exact name** (case-insensitive):

1. **Exact match found**: Contact is linked to existing company
2. **No match found**: New company is created automatically

### Auto-Created Company Details

When a company doesn't exist, it's created with:
- **Name**: From `companyName` field
- **Type**: `UNKNOWN` (can be updated later in admin panel)
- **Status**: Active
- **Verification**: Unverified (needs manual review)
- **Logo**: Auto-generated placeholder

**Example:**
```csv
companyName
Acme Corporation        # If exists: use it, if not: create it
ACME CORPORATION        # Matches "Acme Corporation" (case-insensitive)
Acme Corp              # No match - creates new company "Acme Corp"
```

### Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Use consistent company names across your CSV
- ‚úÖ Check existing companies first in Admin Panel > Organizations > Companies
- ‚úÖ Review auto-created companies after import
- ‚ùå Don't use abbreviations if full name exists in system

---

## Data Validation Rules

- Must be valid email format: `user@domain.com`
