```

### **Data Quality System**
5-tier verification levels:
1. **Basic** (0-20 points)
2. **Verified** (21-40 points) 
3. **Premium Verified** (41-60 points)

## üîß Development Guidelines

### **Code Standards**
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable shadcn/ui components
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling
- **Database**: Prisma with optimized queries and indexes
- **Performance**: Monitor page load times and search responses

### **Key Patterns to Follow**
- Use existing Prisma models and schema
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design
- Preserve authentication and role-based access
- Keep data quality scoring system
- Follow existing UI component patterns

### **Testing Requirements**
- All new features must work on mobile
- Maintain sub-3 second page load times
- Search responses must stay under 1 second
- Preserve all existing functionality during changes
- Test with both admin and regular user accounts

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

### **Performance Targets**
- **Page Load Time**: <3 seconds
- **Search Response**: <1 second
- **Mobile Experience**: Fully functional on all screen sizes
- **Data Volume**: Support 1000+ companies smoothly
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability in production

### **User Experience Goals**
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Users find contacts within 30 seconds
- **Complete Profiles**: All contacts have professional details
- **Action Integration**: Easy email/call/LinkedIn actions
- **Mobile Parity**: Full features available on mobile
- **Data Quality**: High verification scores and accurate info

## üö® Critical Deployment Rules

### **ALWAYS Use OAuth-Safe Deployment**
**CRITICAL**: OAuth integrations (LinkedIn, Google, Stripe) require consistent domains

**‚úÖ CORRECT Production Deployment:**
```bash
vercel --prod --alias getmecca.com
# OR use the npm script:
npm run deploy:prod
```

**‚ùå NEVER Use Random Vercel URLs:**
```bash
vercel --prod  # Creates random URLs that break OAuth
```

**Why This Matters:**
- LinkedIn OAuth only works on `getmecca.com` (registered redirect URI)
- Stripe webhooks are configured for specific domains
- Random Vercel URLs like `dealmecca-abc123.vercel.app` will cause authentication failures
- OAuth providers require pre-registered redirect URIs for security

**OAuth Redirect URIs Currently Registered:**
- `https://getmecca.com/api/linkedin/callback`
- `https://getmecca.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- `http://localhost:3000/api/linkedin/callback` (development)
