**Status:** Ready for Testing
**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 (Authentication) must be complete

---

## Overview

This guide walks through testing all forum features to ensure they work correctly with the post approval workflow and authentication system.

## üîß Code Changes Applied

### ‚úÖ Post Approval Workflow Fixed

**File:** `/app/api/forum/posts/route.ts`
**Change:** Line 454

```typescript
// BEFORE:

### 6. Admin Panel Data Sync

**Objective:** Ensure admin panel shows the same data as frontend

#### Test Scenarios:

| Item | Frontend Location | Admin Location | What to Verify |
|------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Post Count | `/forum` | `/admin/forum/posts` | Total number matches |
| Post Content | Post detail page | Admin edit page | Content identical |
| Comment Count | Post card | Admin post listing | Count matches |
| Bookmark Count | Post stats | Database query | Count matches |
| Post Status | Not visible (filtered) | Admin panel | PENDING/APPROVED shown |
| Categories | Filter dropdown | Admin categories | Same categories |

#### Verification Steps:

1. **Count Posts:**
   - Frontend: Navigate to `/forum`, count visible posts
   - Admin: Navigate to `/admin/forum/posts`, filter by APPROVED, count posts
   - **Expected:** Numbers match

2. **Verify Post Content:**
   - Frontend: Click any post, note title & first paragraph
   - Admin: Find same post in admin panel, check content
   - **Expected:** Content identical

3. **Check Comment Counts:**
   - Frontend: Note comment count on post card
   - Admin: Check same post in admin listing
   - **Expected:** Comment count matches

4. **Pending Posts:**
   - Admin: Filter by status: PENDING
   - Frontend: Verify none of these posts appear in public forum
   - **Expected:** Pending posts hidden from public

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Profile API Still Returns 401

**Problem:**
```
‚ùå Profile API: No user ID found in headers or cookies
GET /api/users/profile 401
```

**Cause:** Legacy endpoint expects `x-user-id` header or `linkedin-auth` cookie instead of Bearer token

**Impact:** Low - doesn't block core forum functionality

**Solution:** Update `/app/api/users/profile/route.ts` to use `requireAuth()` like other endpoints

**Priority:** Medium (can be addressed in Phase 5: Settings)

---

### Issue 2: Prisma Client Cache

**Problem:** Old schema cached in Prisma client causing validation errors

**Solution Applied:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
rm -rf .next
# Restart dev server
```

**Prevention:** Always regenerate Prisma client after schema changes
