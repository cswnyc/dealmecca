# DealMecca Troubleshooting Plan

**Created:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** Phase 1 - In Progress
**Goal:** Systematically fix and verify all application features

---

## Progress Overview

- ‚úÖ **Completed:** 0/6 phases
- üöß **In Progress:** Phase 1 - Authentication Foundation
- ‚è≥ **Pending:** Phases 2-6

---

## Phase 1: Authentication Foundation (CRITICAL) üöß

**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** P0 - Blocking all other phases
**Started:** 2025-10-08

### Problem
All authenticated features returning 401 errors across the application.

### Root Cause
‚úÖ **IDENTIFIED:** No user currently signed in (authentication system is fully functional, just needs a user to authenticate)

### Tasks
- [x] Diagnose authentication system (COMPLETED)
- [x] Identify root cause: no signed-in user (COMPLETED)
- [ ] Create dev authentication page at `/app/dev-auth/page.tsx`
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify 401 errors are resolved
- [ ] Document authentication flow

### Success Criteria
- [ ] User can sign in via dev auth page
- [ ] `auth.currentUser` is not null after sign-in
- [ ] `authedFetch()` successfully sends Bearer token
- [ ] Forum actions (comment, bookmark) work without 401 errors
- [ ] Session cookie (`dealmecca-session`) is set
- [ ] Backend sync completes successfully

### Test Accounts
- **Admin:** admin@dealmecca.pro / password123
- **Pro User:** pro@dealmecca.pro / test123

### Files Modified
- `/app/dev-auth/page.tsx` (to be created)

### Notes
- Firebase auth system confirmed working (onAuthStateChanged active)
- Auth flow: Firebase Auth ‚Üí Get ID Token ‚Üí Send as Bearer ‚Üí requireAuth validates
- Middleware checks for cookies: `auth-token`, `__session`, `linkedin-auth`
- Backend sync endpoint: `/api/auth/firebase-sync` (sets `dealmecca-session` cookie)

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs in via Firebase (Google/LinkedIn/Email)
2. Frontend gets Firebase ID token
3. `authedFetch()` sends token as `Authorization: Bearer {token}`

5. Backend syncs user via `/api/auth/firebase-sync`
6. Session cookie `dealmecca-session` is set
7. User is authenticated
